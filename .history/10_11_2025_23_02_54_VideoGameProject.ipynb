    "The data contains the ages, hours played, subscription status, and experience of each user. By combining players.csv and sessions.csv, I can mutate the start and end time of each session to find the length as well as group_by `hashedEmail` to determine the average session length for each player. With this information I will be able to train a classification algorithm to ascertain the answer to my question. "

    "\n",
    "In order to answer my specific question with the given data, a k-nn classification model would be the most appropriate. Out of the methods introduced in DSCI 100, classification is the only one that predicts a class and therefore more fitting to predict subscription status than regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "K-NN classification does not make many assumptions about the distribution of the data however it does assume that data points close to each other belong to the same class. \n",
    "\n",
    "K-NN classification is biased with imbalanced data (ie significantly more of one class in the data set) and large numbers of predictors. It is also sensitive to the scaling of the predictors and potential outliers. To combat these weaknesses, it will be important to scale and center the predictors as well as consider balancing the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To build my K-NN classification model, I will first split the data into 80% training and 20% testing. In order to determine which of the variables (hours played, age, and average session length) are optimal to use as predictors, I will create a separate model for each combination of predictors and tune each one using 5-fold cross validation. Then I can pick the combination of predictors that yield the highest cross validation accuracy. Furthermore, I can test the accuracy of my model by utilizing the testing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to assess how experience might impact the prediction of subscription status to a game-related newsletter, I can group the training data by experience then train different models that are tuned with 5-fold cross validation. From there, I can compare the cross validation accuracies. "
